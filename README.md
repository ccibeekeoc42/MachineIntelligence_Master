### The Basics

1. [**ML Definition**] How do you define machine learning?
    - *"A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."* - Arthur Samuel (1959).

2. [**ML Algorithms**] What are some of the most common ML algorithms used today?
    - Supervised Learning
        - Spam filtering, speech recognition, machine translation, online advertising, self-driving, visual inspection/ defect detection etc.
    - Unsupervised Learning
        - Clustering, anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction
    - Recommender Systems
    - Reinforcement Learning

3. [**Supervised Algorithms**] What are the two main types of supervised learning algorithms?  (learning from labels)
    - Classification: pridict a small/ finite/ limited number of possible categories.
    - Regression: fitting a curve through a dataset or predicting a number from infinitely many possible outputs.
        - Linear regression
        - Logistic regression

4. [**Unsupervised Algorithms**] What is the aim of unsupervised learning algorithms?
    - find some structure/ insights from unlabeled data. For example, clustering data like news.



### Projects
1. [**Instagram Reach**] Here we analyze how the impressions of instagram posts relate to other factors like Follows, like etc.
    - check the `InstagramReach.ipynb` file for reference.

2. [**Online Fraud Detection**] Here we try to classify transactions as fraudulent or not.
    - check the `FraudDetection.ipynb` file for reference.
